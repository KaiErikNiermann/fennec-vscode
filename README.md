- Snippets for basic constructs 

## Known Issues

I put this together quite quickly so there might still be some issues with the highlighting of certain stuff. If you come across any issues or have suggestions for enhancement, please don't hesitate to [raise them here](https://github.com/KaiErikNiermann/fennec-vscode/issues).
